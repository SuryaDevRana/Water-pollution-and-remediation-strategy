                    <p2>The Water Pollution effect<br/></p>
                    <p>There are many reasons for water pollution. Some of the reasons are directly affected by water pollution and some indirectly. Many factories and industries are dumping contaminated water, chemicals, and heavy metals into major waterways as a result of direct water pollution. 

                        One more reason for water pollution is the use of modern techniques in farms. Farmers apply nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium in the form of chemical fertilizers, manure, and sludge. It causes farms to discharge large quantities of agrochemicals, organic matter, and saline drainage into water bodies. It indirectly affects water pollution.
                        
                        Pollutants can be of various types such as organic, inorganic, radioactive etc. Water pollutants are discharged either from one point from pipes, channels etc., which are called point sources or from various other sources. They can be agricultural areas, industries etc., called dispersed sources.

    <h2 style="color: red;"> What is Water Pollution?</h2>
    <div id="earth"></div>

    <p>Water pollution can be defined as the contamination of water bodies. Water pollution is caused when water bodies such as rivers, 
        lakes, oceans, groundwater and aquifers get contaminated with industrial and agricultural effluents.

        When water gets polluted, it adversely affects all lifeforms that directly or indirectly depend on this source. The effects of water contamination can be felt for years to come.<br>

         <img src="depositphotos_10711243-stock-photo-global-warming-factory-emissions-pollution.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Water pollution is a significant decrease in water resources'
        quality due to the ingress of various chemicals and solid waste into streams, rivers, lakes, seas, 
        and oceans, or the multiplication of microscopic living organisms. The causes of water pollution are related 
        to human activities. After observing the Drinking Water Supply and Quality Report 2018 and 2019, 
        it has become clear that tap water in New York is considered one of the world's highest quality. 
        New York City receives drinking water from 19 reservoirs and three controlled lakes, located in a watershed of almost 2,000 square miles (“NYC Environmental Protection,” 2018). This drainage basin is located 125 miles north of New York City, in the Hudson Valley and the Catskills (“NYC Environmental Protection,” 2018). Drinking water does not require cleaning; however, to comply with all sanitary standards, it still disinfects with chlorine and ultraviolet radiation.

        Meanwhile, despite all positive features of the NYC water supply system, several issues exist, including the changes in water quality and the chemical substances found after investigation provided by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). The specific reason for the difference in water condition is the closure for repairs of one of the two aqueducts through which water from the Catskill watershed enters New York. In October 2018, the reservoirs of Westchester and Dutchess counties were involved in the city’s uninterrupted supply (“NYC Environmental Protection,” 2019). The water in these reservoirs is saturated with minerals – particularly calcium and magnesium – and therefore has a characteristic smell and taste (Hoang et al., 2019). This water is considered moderately heavy and leaves a residue on dishes and can clog sewer pipes. Previously, the share of its use in the water supply in New York City did not exceed ten percent, after this, the figure is twenty to thirty percent. Most of the water is supplied to Manhattan and parts of the Bronx.
        
        The nonprofit Environmental Working Group (EWG) has released details on toxic chemicals present in water systems. Data from the EWG study materials show that drinking water in New York City does not meet health guidelines (“New York City System,” n.d). Six different pollutants associated with cancer have been found in the water (“New York City System,” n.d). Their level significantly exceeds the recommendations established by the health authorities but does not go beyond the legal norms. There are chemicals in the water, including chloroform, bromodichloromethane, and dichloroacetic acid (“New York City System,” n.d). Health authorities recommend that the amount of chloroform in water should not exceed the proportion of one in a billion. According to the EWG, it corresponds to one case of cancer in a million inhabitants, while New York City’s water level is 30.9 per billion (“New York City System,” n.d). Meanwhile, even this amount poses health risks to New Yorkers.
        Concerning human health, frequent drinking of chlorinate water can increase the number 
        of cancer cases, liver damage, low birth weight in babies, and other health problems. Chlorine interacts with other substances to form trihalomethanes; the most dangerous of these is chloroform, which leads to liver cancer. Moreover, epidemiologists compared a map of the distribution of tumors of the bladder and intestines in the United States with a plan of water chlorination. It turned out that where people drink this water, tumor cases are wide-spread (Li & Wu, 2019). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has explored that water pollution could affect more than 110 million Americans (Li & Wu, 2019). If people live in a region where potable water has been contaminated, it will become impossible to avoid contact with chemicals.<br>

     A planet that has never been hotter. Nine of the 10 warmest years since 1880 have occurred since 2005—and the 5 warmest years on record have all occurred since 2015. Climate change deniers have argued that there has been a “pause” or a “slowdown” in rising global temperatures, but numerous studies, including a 2018 paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, have disproved this claim. The impacts of global warming are already harming people around the world.

     Now climate scientists have concluded that we must limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040 
     if we are to avoid a future in which everyday life around the world is marked by its worst, most devastating effects: 
     the extreme droughts, wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and other disasters that we refer to collectively as climate change. 
     These effects are felt by all people in one way or another but are experienced most acutely by the underprivileged,
      the economically marginalized, and people of color, 
     for whom climate change is often a key driver of poverty, displacement, hunger, and social unrest.

    <h2  style="color: red ;">What Are the Causes of Water Pollution?</h2><br>



    <p>There are many causes of water pollution, some of them are:<br>
        <br>

        <h6 style="color: rgb(191, 7, 207) ;">1) Sewage or wastewater:</h6>
        The waste from households, factories, or agricultural land gets discharged into rivers or lakes. This waste can either be in the form of liquid waste, garbage, or sewage. The harmful chemicals oozing out of this waste can damage aquatic life.
        <br><h6 style="color: rgb(191, 7, 207) ;">2) Dumping:</h6>
        Most water bodies get converted into dumping grounds by nearby localities. And this causes a huge problem because the dump contains everything from plastic, aluminum to glass, Styrofoam, etc. And since all the waste takes different time to degrade in the water, they tend to harm the aquatic life until degraded.
        <br>
        <br><h6 style="color: rgb(191, 7, 207) ;"> 3) Oil pollution:</h6>
        One of the worst types of water pollution is oil pollution. This is because the oil spills from tankers and ships tend to create a thick layer above the water in seas or oceans. And since oil doesn’t dissolve, the sludge stays forever.
        <br>
        <h6 style="color: rgb(191, 7, 207) ;">4- Acid rain:</h6><br>
        Even though acid rain may seem like a natural problem but it is wise to note that Acid rains are caused due to acidic particles in the contaminated air. These particles in the atmosphere get mixed with water vapor and result in acid rains.
        <br> <h6 style="color: rgb(191, 7, 207) ;"> 5) Industrial waste:</h6>
        <br>
        Industrial waste is filled with lead, asbestos, petrochemicals, and even mercury. All of these chemicals are highly hazardous for both humans and aquatic life. But, many industries tend to discharge the waste into major water bodies like rivers and lakes around living localities, thus, contaminating the fresh water.
        <br>
        What impacts does water pollution have on the ecosystem?<br>
        <h6 style="color: rgb(191, 7, 207) ;">1) Diseases:</h6>
        Not just the aquatic life, even when the humans end up drinking polluted water, they make themselves vulnerable to various life-threatening illnesses like hepatitis, cholera, typhoid, and many other water-borne diseases.
        <br>
        <h6 style="color: rgb(191, 7, 207) ;">2) Ruination of the ecosystem:</h6><br>
        Our ecosystem is extremely fragile. Even a simple change can lead the ecosystem to react and impact the environment. If the water system is unchecked in a particular locality, then the whole ecosystem of that particular area may collapse.
        <br>
        <h6 style="color: rgb(191, 7, 207) ;">3) Eutrophication:</h6><br>
        The chemicals available in the water body promote the growth of algae. These algae end up forming a thick layer over the ponds and lakes. The bacteria present in the water tend to feed on algae, causing the amount of oxygen in the water to decrease, thus impacting the aquatic life of the entire water body.
        <br>
        <h6 style="color: rgb(191, 7, 207) ;">4) Adverse impact on the food chain:</h6><br>
        <br>
        If the aquatic life tends to accommodate as per the polluted water, 
        it is highly possible that the marine species may have toxins and pollutants in their body.<br> When humans tend to feed on fishes, shellfishes, or other aquatic species, they end up consuming the toxins and pollutants too. <img src="depositphotos_3845974-stock-photo-global-warming.jpg" alt="..."><br><br>
     


    <h2 style="color: red;">What Are the Effects of Water Pollution ? </h2><br>

    
<ol>
    <li><strong>Impact on Ecosystems:</strong> Water pollution disrupts aquatic ecosystems by harming or killing aquatic plants and animals. It can disrupt food chains and decrease biodiversity.</li>
    <li><strong>Drinking Water Contamination:</strong> Polluted water sources can contaminate drinking water supplies, leading to health issues when consumed by humans or animals. Contaminants like heavy metals, pathogens, and chemical pollutants can cause illnesses ranging from gastrointestinal problems to more serious conditions such as neurological disorders or cancer.</li>
    <li><strong>Habitat Destruction:</strong> Pollution can destroy the habitats of aquatic organisms, making it difficult for them to survive and reproduce. This can lead to population declines or even extinction of species.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Water pollution can have significant economic consequences, including the loss of revenue from fisheries and tourism, as well as the costs associated with cleaning up polluted water sources and treating water for human consumption.</li>
    <li><strong>Harm to Agriculture:</strong> Contaminated water used for irrigation can harm crops, affecting agricultural productivity and potentially leading to food shortages.</li>
    <li><strong>Algal Blooms:</strong> Nutrient pollution, particularly from agricultural runoff containing fertilizers, can lead to the overgrowth of algae in water bodies. These algal blooms can deplete oxygen levels in the water, leading to fish kills and the formation of dead zones where aquatic life cannot survive.</li>
    <li><strong>Aesthetic and Recreational Impact:</strong> Water pollution can make water bodies unsightly and unpleasant to be around, discouraging recreational activities such as swimming, boating, and fishing.</li>
    <li><strong>Long-Term Environmental Damage:</strong> Some pollutants, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals, can persist in the environment for long periods of time, accumulating in sediments and organisms and causing ongoing harm to ecosystems.</li>
    <li><strong>Climate Change Exacerbation:</strong> Water pollution can exacerbate climate change by releasing greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide from polluted water bodies, contributing to global warming.</li>
    <li><strong>Human Health Impacts:</strong> In addition to contaminating drinking water, water pollution can also affect human health through direct contact with polluted water during recreational activities or through the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish. Exposure to pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and industrial chemicals can lead to a variety of health problems, including respiratory issues, skin diseases, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders.</li>

    <br>

    <h2 style="color: red;">Who Is Most Impacted by Water Pollution?</h2>

    <p>Although global warming impacts everyone, not everyone is impacted equally.
         Marginalized and disadvantaged communities, such as low-income communities,
          Indigenous peoples, women and children, and those living in areas with high 
          levels of exposure to climate-related risks, are typically the most impacted by global warming. <br>
        The negative impacts of global warming disproportionately affect marginalized 
        communities who are already disadvantaged due to systemic inequities in housing,
         health care, and labor. These communities — despite contributing the least to global warming — 
         are more vulnerable to its worst effects.</p><br>
    <br>
    <img src="water.png" alt="..." > <br><br>


    <h2 style="color: red;">Who Is Most Responsible for Water Pollution ?</h2>


    <p>According to Carbon Brief, the United States is the nation most responsible for the climate crisis,
         having released 20% of all emissions historically.
          But it's not just the US to blame: the richest 20 countries in 
          the world are responsible for just under 80% of greenhouse gas emissions overall.
           This means that most emissions come from a small number of countries, while those
            least responsible for the climate crisis are experiencing its worst impacts.</p><br>
    <img src="gettyimages-157419001-612x612.jpg" alt="...">
    <p>Ultimately, the wealthiest are the most responsible,
         whether it's nations or individuals. As the UN highlights, for example,
          the combined emissions of the richest 1% of the world's
           population are larger than the combined emissions of the poorest 50%. 
        The average billionaire's annual emissions are a million times higher
         than a person in the poorest 90% of the world's population, says Oxfam. 
         In fact, the annual emissions of just 125 billionaires (through their investments) 
         are the equivalent of those of France. </p><br>

<p>Water pollution has devastating effects on aquatic life, ecosystems, 
    economies, and human health. It leads to habitat degradation, biodiversity loss, 
    economic losses in industries like agriculture and tourism, and serious health risks
     including gastrointestinal illnesses and chronic diseases. Children are particularly vulnerable,
     facing developmental impairments. Water pollution exacerbates climate change by emitting greenhouse gases.
      Urgent action is needed through stringent regulations, sustainable infrastructure investment, 
      pollution prevention strategies, and public awareness campaigns to address this pressing global 
      crisis and secure a healthier future for all.</p>
